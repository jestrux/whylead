                    This is Thrive Squad's story. Legend has it, they've been developing leaders, helping

                <p class="mt-2 text-base/loose opacity-70">
                    We started with the question, Why Lead? And this question led to a simple survey that we shared with
                    leaders across many organizations.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-base/loose opacity-70">
                    The results were shocking. Leaders were struggling. Alot of
                    organizational success hinged on their participation, yet it felt like they were the only ones who
                    cared. We understood the work and life of a leader, and we said, it’s time to step in and help.

                <p class="mt-2 text-base/loose opacity-70">
                    And
                    that’s how WhyLead was started. To partner with leaders and organizations and provide the support
                    needed to thrive.
