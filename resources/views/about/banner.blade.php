                <p class="mt-1 text-base/loose opacity-70">
                    We began with a simple but profound question: Why lead? This inquiry sparked a
                    survey distributed to leaders across numerous organizations, and the findings
                    were startling.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3 text-base/loose opacity-70">
                    Leaders were facing significant challenges; although much of an organization's
                    success depended on their involvement, they often felt isolated in their efforts.
                    Recognizing the crucial role and challenges of leadership, we knew it was time to
                    Intervene.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3 text-base/loose opacity-70">
                    This was the genesis of WhyLead &mdash; created to forge partnerships with leaders and
                    organizations, providing the essential support they need to Thrive.

                    We are committed to empowering leaders and organizations to thrive. We achieve this by nurturing
                    leadership talent and cultivating a workplace culture that serves the organization's mission and
                    strategic goals.
