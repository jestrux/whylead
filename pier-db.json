In this episode, he discusses the misconceptions around happiness, particularly the belief that material success leads to happiness. Tal argues that money is a means to an end, not an end in itself and that pursuing it as such can lead to disappointment and unhappiness. Instead, he suggests that the ultimate currency, by which we should measure our lives, is happiness. He emphasizes that happiness is not just about feeling good in the moment, but also about having a sense of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in all aspects of life. Tal also introduces his Spire model of happiness, which consists of spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational, and emotional well-being. He explains that financial well-being is a derivative of the primary attributes of well-being and should not be the central focus of our lives. To become happier, Tal suggests focusing on cultivating the primary attributes of well-being, which will ultimately lead to a more fulfilling life. This includes finding meaning and purpose in our work and relationships, as well as taking care of our physical and emotional health. In conclusion, Tal encourages listeners to shift their focus from material success to happiness in all aspects of their lives.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>https:\/\/www.happinessstudies.academy\/ <\/p><p><br><\/p><p>https:\/\/talbenshahar.com\/ <\/p><p><br><\/p><p>https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/tal-ben-shahar\/?trk=public_post-text <\/p>","season":2,"dateMeta":{"regular":"March 28, 2023","short":"Mar 28, 2023","full":"March 28, 2023, 9:13 PM"}},{"_id":"13959483","image":"https:\/\/storage.buzzsprout.com\/gx7kkr9bktmibh5pswaxj8vmd8rr","title":"The Hero's Journey: How Leaders Can Guide Their Teams to Success","featuring":"Dr. J.J.
